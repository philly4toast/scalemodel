# Full Stack Review Workshop
//will need to review editing tricks for readme

Welcome to Scale Models! 

Here is a list of things I've built. From scale models to fire arms, we will provide history and information about each item. 

CODING RELEVANCE for LEARNING
This is an app to exercise CRUD operations. Some languages/terms to be familiar with: HTML, REACT, JQUERY, AJAX, SQL, EXPRESS

HOW TO GET APP STARTED
1. CLONE from git 

-hypothesis-
2. Set up dev environment (?)
  Make sure all dependencies are installed
  Start server, and database

3. SET UP DATABASE
  My hypothesis is that the database needs to be seeded. The error that we are currently receiving - sqlState: '08004' indicates that our source database is not available locally. 
    It appears we need to have certain databases made available first. 

    q: Why does the page fail to start up? Shouldn't we be able to see our basic HTML mockup without the data(pictures/details) on the page?
